        The ability to understand natural language queries is a big deal. You can ask,
         for example: “I’m going to be in Boston. I like basketball. What do you suggest, Watson?”
          You might get several answers: Celtics tickets, Boston College tickets, Harvard tickets.
           Or in the offseason, Watson may suggest you drive to the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield (MA).
            Companies are already using Watson this way. Fluid, Inc.’s Watson-based retail solutions deliver
             granular results to queries such as “I am taking my wife and three children camping in upstate New York 
             in October and I need a tent.” Consider this: Watson has been taught to pass the medical boards. 
             Would you trust it to diagnose you and prescribe medication? 
             What if you claim to be in pain (e.g., back pain, migraines, depression) 
             and Watson doesn’t believe your subjective input? Here’s more food for thought:
              What if Watson could learn to code? Why not? It’s hardly heretical to 
              suggest that as Watson works with developers, it will one day be able to generate
               solutions based on a natural language query. That’s equally exciting and worrisome.
                Now if you want to poke a little fun at Watson, read this Steve Lohr piece
                 in The New York Times (2013) about Watson in the kitchen. Just skim it -- the kicker is at the end.
